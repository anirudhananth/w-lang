Current Focus:
- Currently, we're focusing on trying to parse functions correctly.
- This includes checking for correct brace checks and error checking for function definitions.
- Parser C code might need some structural modification to make it more dynamic.

Planned Features:
- Fix function error checking.
- Implement arithmetic operations and variable declarations.
